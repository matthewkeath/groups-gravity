==============================================================================

* 1.2.1
  - Fixed: Subscriptions status check needed to validate entry as subscription
           to avoid validating non-subscriptions as active subscriptions on
           'Processing' status.
  - Added: 'Paid' payment_status is recognized and payments are considered
           valid when they are either 'Approved' or 'Paid' to act on
           group assignments based on payments.
  - Added: Translation template

* 1.2.0
